# Standard Pivot-Table-and-Power-Pivot-Table-with-Dashboard
Standard Pivot Table: Itâ€™s a well-prepared report from a customer database for a Bike-Selling Company to understand the trend of purchasing behaviour of different genders at different ages in different regions (Europe, North America, Pacific) of the world, the occupation of a customer, and the commuting distance to motivate the purchase of a bike.
There so many parameters are given in the dashboard (Using Slicer), from where a Data analyst can get a fair idea about the customer behaviour and will implement the accurate strategy towards the most frequent buyer or introduce new policies or safety to cover the middle-aged and old age people as well as for the persons with children.
Power Pivot Table: Through this Pivot Chart, we can analyse our top clients and upcoming potential clients as well as dormant clients. 
We can get an idea about the profit margin of each of our product types.
Thank you so much for your time.
