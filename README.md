# Standard Pivot-Table-and-Power-Pivot-Table-with-Dashboard
Standard Pivot Table: It’s a well-prepared report from a customer database for a Bike-Selling Company to understand the trend of purchasing behaviour of different genders at different ages in different regions (Europe, North America, Pacific) of the world, the occupation of a customer, and the commuting distance to motivate the purchase of a bike.
There so many parameters are given in the dashboard (Using Slicer), from where a Data analyst can get a fair idea about the customer behaviour and will implement the accurate strategy towards the most frequent buyer or introduce new policies or safety to cover the middle-aged and old age people as well as for the persons with children.

Standard Pivot Table 2:
In this visual (Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts), we can understand about:
•	The performance of our Top 5 Managers within which month and in which category as well as in which location. (Please use slicers). – (from this analysis, we encourage our top Performed managers to keep going by giving them job satisfaction or bonuses or hikes in salary, and sometimes a percentage of commission will fuel their energy more.)
•	The performance of each store in which month and in which category (Please Use Slicers). (Through this we can identify less progressed stores and will try to operate the media store, if we fail then we may close that store)
•	The sales performance according to month. ( we can identify the best/lowest performance months, and then during the lowest performance month, we can focus on our other activities, e.g. Training our employees with advanced technologies. 

Power Pivot Table: Through this Pivot Chart, we can analyse our top clients and upcoming potential clients as well as dormant clients. 
We can get an idea about the profit margin of each of our product types.
