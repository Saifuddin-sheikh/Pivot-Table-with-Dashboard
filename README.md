# Pivot-Table-with-Dashboard
Itâ€™s a well-prepared report from a customer database for a Bike-Selling Company to understand the trend of purchasing behaviour of different genders at different ages in different regions (Europe, North America, Pacific) of the world, the occupation of a customer, and the commuting distance to motivate the purchase of a bike.
There so many parameters are given in the dashboard (Using Slicer), from where a Data analyst can get a fair idea about the customer behaviour and will implement the accurate strategy towards the most frequent buyer or introduce new policies or safety to cover the middle-aged and old age people as well as for the persons with children.
Thank you for your Time.
